he changed all the ints to the other int in the liked list 

how do i have any controll over when one thread is writing and another is reading 
i have 0 controll over when he acceses memory 

remember to use mutex init and mutex destroy on the locks 

use trylock to lock to not create deadlock when locking something twice
